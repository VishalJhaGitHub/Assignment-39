    "#1 - Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and language translation. AI can be broadly categorized into two types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which aims to replicate human intelligence in its entirety. An example of narrow AI is a chatbot that uses natural language processing to provide customer service, while an example of general AI is a hypothetical robot that could understand and solve any problem that a human could.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 - Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training a machine to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. It works by providing the machine with data and allowing it to identify patterns and relationships within that data, which it can then use to make predictions or decisions about new data. Machine learning can be further divided into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. An example of machine learning is training a model to predict whether a given email is spam or not based on past examples of spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 - Deep Learning (DL) is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks, which are modeled after the structure of the human brain, to learn from data. Deep learning is particularly effective at processing large amounts of unstructured data such as images, video, and audio. It involves training a neural network with multiple layers to learn progressively complex representations of the data, allowing it to make more accurate predictions or decisions. An example of deep learning is training a convolutional neural network to recognize objects in images, such as cats, dogs, or cars."

    "#1 - Training Set: The training set is used to train the machine learning model. The model is fitted to the training data by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The training set is typically the largest subset of the data, as the model needs enough data to learn from to make accurate predictions.\n",

It is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting, which is when the model becomes too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The validation set is not used for training the model, but rather for adjusting the parameters and evaluating the performance of the model on data that it has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 - Test Set: The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the machine learning model after it has been trained and validated. It is used to estimate the generalization error of the model, which is the error rate that is expected when the model is applied to new, unseen data. The test set should be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the generalization error, and should not be used for training or validation.\n",

Anomalies can be identified as data points that are far from the majority of the data in this lower-dimensional space.\n",

    "#Unsupervised anomaly detection can be particularly useful in applications where labeled data is scarce or where the types of anomalies that may occur are not known in advance. For example, in network security, unsupervised anomaly detection can be used to detect unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate a cyber attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#It is important to note that unsupervised anomaly detection may not be able to distinguish between anomalies that are genuine and those that are due to errors or noise in the data. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate and interpret the results of any anomaly detection algorithm and combine it with expert knowledge and domain-specific information."
